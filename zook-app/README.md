# Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) - Java

## Project Description

In this social network, everyone is friends with everyone. As a user, you will be able to register and login to your account. When you successfully login, you are automatically friends with everyone which means you will see a feed of everyone's posts. Users will be able to create a post and like other people's posts. Users will also have the ability to view other profiles which will display posts of that specific user.

## Technologies Used

* Java - version 11
* JavScript
* HTML
* CSS
* AWS EC2 and SW3
* Spring Boot
* JUnit

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* New users can create and register accounts
* Profanity filter on all user input (both in JavaScript for speed, and on the Server for security)
* View a global feed of all posts, only their feed, or only a single user's feed.  The feeds include both images and the original comment by the poster.
* Users can "Like" a post
* Upload and view youTube videos
* Update profile and user picture

To-do list:
* Profanity filter responses on posts (already implemented on Create Account)
* Sort posts by descending order
